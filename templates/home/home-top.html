<p>This site details my experiences with the big hobby, ham radio.  I am licensed as an amateur (ham) radio operator by the Federal Communications Commission.  My call sign is WA7PGE.</p>
<p>I was first licensed in 1970 as WN7PGE and then as WA7PGE. I enjoyed many aspects of the hobby.  But I moved on to other interests in 1974.   In 2024 my interest was rekindled, and I'm documenting some of my experiences here.  </p>
