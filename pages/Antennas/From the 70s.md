## My History with Antennas
In the 1970s, antennas were a huge part of my exploration, discovery and learning in ham radio.   Here's what I remember of what I built: 

- Trap Dipole for 80/40/15
- Portable wire yagi for 20 meters
- Helically wound mobile antenna for 40 meters
- Cubical Quad for 20 meters
- Vertical quarter wave for 10 meters

The archival record only includes pictures of the cubical quad.
