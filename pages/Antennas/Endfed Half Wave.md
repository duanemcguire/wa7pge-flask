title: 80 Meter Endfed Halfwave
---
I have come to realize that the endfed halfwave antenna is a great multi-band antenna. 

I installed an 80 meter half wave along the line shown in the image below.   That's approximately 130 feet of wire.  The high point is at 55 feet tied off to the tree.  The end and the feedpoint are about 25 feet high.

**Pros:**

* Presents SWR < 3:1 on all HF bands
* The 18 guage copperweld is virtually invisible
* Simple deployment
* Low maintenance

Experience with the antenna over the past four months has been great.  The antenna is fed with a 49:1 balun.
