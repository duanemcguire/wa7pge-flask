title: SKCC Weekend Sprintathon - Homebrew Key
---
For August, the theme for the [weekend sprintathon of The Straight Key Century Club](https://skccgroup.com/operating_activities/weekend_sprintathon/submit-display.php?sort_order=Submission+Order&results_id=223#WA7PGE)  was homebrew keys. 

 For the homebrew key, I modified a grand piano action model. The modification de-regulated the action of the model so that it would be awful for a pianist! It wasn't too bad as a morse key, but with the long lever arms, it had a spongy feel. It took a heavy touch to operate and was tiring, but all of my 13 QSOs were made with this key.
