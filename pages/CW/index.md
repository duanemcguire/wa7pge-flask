CW for hams is Morse code mode.  CW stands for Continuous Wave.  In other words it is an un-modulated radio signal sent just as the dits and dahs of Morse code.   There are many digital modes in ham radio, but  Morse code is the grand-daddy of them all.  It is a human-readable digital mode that can offer a unique skill challenge and personal satisfaction.  

When I was first licensed, sending and receiving Morse code proficiently was a licensing requirement.  I spent many hours learning it and practicing it as a Novice class amateur radio operator in 1970 and 71.   

When I came back to ham radio this year, I had remembered the basics but I still need lots of practice to be completely competent.  I'm pretty well back to where I was in the seventies, but I need to be better for today's ham radio world.  

Recently, nearly all of my radio contacts have been with CW.   In early summer, I had the good fortune to enroll in the 8-week intermediate CW skills class with [CW Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/).   The course challenged me and advanced my skills: particularly with the copying the code mentally without transcribing it to paper.   That's a skill that I never developed in my earlier practice.  In October I joined [Long Island CW Club](https://longislandcwclub.org/), and have been participating in their excellent instructional program.   I continue in my quest to make CW a conversational language.
