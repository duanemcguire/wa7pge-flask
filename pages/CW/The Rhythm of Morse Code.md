title: The Rhythm of Morse Code
---

I recently watched the video [Keymanship 101 Part 1 -The Beat and Rhythms of Morse](https://youtu.be/noBXQRrx5rg) by Chris, NW6V.   It's a great presentation.  If you do Morse, you'll want to see it!

I'm a musician; I always have been.  What I've noticed in the past is that when I'm in the zone and the CW is flowing out of the key and into the ether, my head starts bobbing or my foot starts tapping.  It just happens, and  with that rhythmic bobbing and swaying, I know I'm sending good code.  And now Chris' presentation exposes the technical foundation for what my body is telling me.
