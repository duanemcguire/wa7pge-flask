title: Pick from list
---

When teaching my Intermediate CW class on Zoom for the Long Island CW club, a couple of instructor procedures  can be aided with the [Pick from List](/static/pick-from-list.html) utility.

Often I will want to choose students successivly and ask them to send a phrase or sentence in CW.  In zoom, I will  send a direct message to the one student in Zoom's chat (while other students cannot see the text sent).    That's simple enough.   

- Identify the student
- Copy a line
- Paste into the chat for that student
- Send

The utility makes it a bit easier.  
First,  to select a student, one could go around the display of participants, top-to-bottom, left-to-right, or some other pattern.  That works.   But  I'd really rather do it in a random order to keep them all guessing who is next.   That makes tracking who has had a turn more difficult.  The  [Pick from List](/static/pick-from-list.html) utility makes that simpler.
Put the class list in the input field, and use "Pick One Random Item" until the list is exhausted. 

Second, in another browser window, use the utility to pick a phrase.  The utility will  assure it is a new phrase, and once picked, it will **automatically copy the selected item** to the clipboard for subsequent pasting.   Much more efficient!
