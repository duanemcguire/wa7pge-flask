[Parks on the Air (POTA)](https://parksontheair.com/), is an ongoing amateur radio activity that encourages hams to set up portable operations in public parks and contact others throughout the nation and world.  Hams who go to parks and set up portable operations are known as **activators,** while those contacting the activators are known as **hunters**.

The activity includes an awards structure, but I am primarily attracted to exploring the natural world with POTA.  Participating as a hunter, I take the time to learn about each park.  So I've wanted to document my activity as more than a logbook.  In [Parks Hunted](Parks_on_the_Air/Parks%20Hunted.md)  I show expanded information for each virtual visit.
