My CW was better, but I was still stressed.  It was fun to hear one call that  I also worked when at Antelope Island the previous week. 

I took our little teardrop trailer for the shade that the awning could provide.  Our dogs, Bebop and Jazzy, came with me.  That was fun for them and more work for me.   So much work, that I forgot to take pictures.   I like being out there where the electrical noise drops to nil!
