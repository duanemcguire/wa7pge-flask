**2025-03-31 -- 13 CW QSOs**
Interesting:
- Don, [KC0DWZ](https://qrz.com/db/KC0DWZ) answered my CQ on 15 meters.   Don is an instructor at Long Island CW Club.   That was good fun. 
- Surprisingly 10 meters gave me two European contacts, [DD1DL](https://qrz.com/db/DD1DL) and [F4ILH](https://qrz.com/db/F4ILH).   I sure fumbled the copy.  I had to ask for repeats several times with each.  There is no way I was expecting a European contact this morning.

**2025-03-28 -- 9 QSOs**
I spent several hours with family and dogs.  Ryan and I experimented with various antennas and rigs.   We enjoyed a nice lunch in the motorhome.  

**2024-08-09 â€“ 10 QSOs** 
**Hooray!**  My first activation  
It was fun and challenging.  I got out to the island by 9 am before it got too hot, and set up at a picnic  shelter near Lady Finger Point.  I configured the [portable vertical antenna](../../Antennas/Portable%20Vertical.md) that I built recently for 20 meters.  I'm still not a great [CW](../../Operating_Modes/CW.md) operator, but  I wanted to do POTA CW.  After 7 contacts I was pretty wiped out from the stress of it all.  I went to SSB for one contact, and then came back to CW for two more.  With 10 contacts, I called it a day after working at it for an hour.
