**12 CW QSOs 2024-09-16**

My CW was more acceptable today.  I was pleased that I could pull in some weak signals, through repetitive confirmation of callsigns.  The activation location along highway 6 in Raymond was not a real park like environment, but a parking area and a picnic table were available.   On this trip I've started to think about putting together a low power (QRP) rig, antenna, battery, etc that will fit in a backpack.  With that, activations can get into the heart of the parks.

The activation site along Highway 6 in Raymond

Willapa Hills is a special place for me, since it traverses my hometown of Raymond, Washington.  The trail is the  old 50+ mile Northern Pacific spur line from Chehalis to South Bend, Washington.  As I got ready for this visit to Washington, activating this park was at the top of my list.   

In 2017, I bicycled the eastern half of the  trail with my daughter Erin, from Chehalis to Rainbow Falls State Park.  That was a joy.  It was also good to check it off the bucket list.  It would be quite a challenge seven years later.  

Last year, with my son, Ryan and daughter, Erin we walked about 4 miles of the trail on the western end from Raymond to Willapa.
