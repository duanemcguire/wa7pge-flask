The South Puget Sound Unit, within the city limits of Lakewood, is home to the Urban Wildlife Interpretive Center and the Lakewood Fish Hatchery. A paved trail offers opportunities for walking and is accessible for persons with disabilities. The unit is one of the last remnants of South Puget Sound prairie ecosystem that once stretched across thousands of acres in the region.
