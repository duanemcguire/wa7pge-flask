Mount Spokane State Park is a 12,444-acre park in the Selkirk Mountains with 100 miles of trails and panoramic views from the summit of 5,883-foot Mount Spokane. The mixed-use trails vary in difficulty for hiking, biking, and horseback riding in the summer to snowshoeing, Nordic skiing and snowmobiling in the winter. During summer, trek through Ponderosa pines and subalpine meadows filled with bear grass, wildflowers and huckleberries, a local favorite.
