For a Washington native, it feels strange to discover a "new" state park along the North Cascades Highway.   It has been so many years since I have been in that area.  It is a beautiful area, and I need to get back there.  

As I recall the North Cascades Highway was completed around 1971 (I'll need to fact check that).  I remember, in particular, a trip to the area as a child, before the highway was completed.  My dad, Harvey McGuire, was a electric meter technician at Pacific County PUD.  He had a number of training sessions on meter technology at Seattle City Light, and he admired the work that Seattle City Light had done over the years.   The trip that I recall was a family tour of the hydro-electric projects of Seattle City Light there on the Skagit.   Visiting the generator floor, deep in the bowels of Ross Dam, was an exceptional experience.
