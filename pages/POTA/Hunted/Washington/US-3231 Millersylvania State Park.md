As a kid, we had many camping trips to Deep Lake at Millersylvania Park. 

On a return trip in 2017,  I took this picture of the swimming area there.  I spent many hours in that water in the 1960s.   I took the picture particularly it reminded me of seeing a daily swimmer from across the lake back in the 60s.  (That must be his house!)
