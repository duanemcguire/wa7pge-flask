Swinging Gate Fish and Wildlife Area is a 156-acre property in southern St. Croix County. It was purchased in 1999 as part of the Kinnickinnic River Fisheries Area and expanded to its current acreage in 2010 with a generous donation from the Kinnickinnic River Land Trust. The property consists exclusively of grassland habitat, with the Kinnickinnic River, a world-class trout stream, cutting through the northwest corner. The property is managed as part of the Western Prairie Habitat Restoration Area, a landscape-scale wetland and grassland restoration project.
