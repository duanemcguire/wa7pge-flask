New Munster Wildlife Area is 1,226-acre property located in western Kenosha County. The property can be found approximately 6 miles west of the Village of Paddock Lake off of Highway KD.

In 1947, the Wisconsin Conservation Commission created the New Munster Wildlife Area. The wildlife area was established to provide important pheasant and upland game habitat in a rapidly developing area of Wisconsin.
