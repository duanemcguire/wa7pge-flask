title: US-9846 Hook Lake Bog - Grass Lake State Wildlife Area
---

Hook Lake Bog ranks as one of the highest-quality wetlands in Dane County and is a state natural area. It is a soft bog lake, which is unusual for southern Wisconsin. The lake, located in a glacial pocket, is nearly extinct with only 50-70 acres of open water remaining. The rest is covered by a floating sedge mat and emergent aquatic vegetation with tamarack swamp forest, open bog and southern sedge meadow communities. An upland island of dry-mesic forest is also present and is rich with spring wildflowers. The natural area also contains a restored prairie and oak savanna along the western edge of the lake. The diversity and structure of the vegetation offer a variety of habitats and cover for wildlife, including open water, reed beds, sedge, cat-tails, shrub, deciduous and coniferous forest areas.
