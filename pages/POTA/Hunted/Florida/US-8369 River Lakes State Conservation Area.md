Enjoy boating, primitive camping, or hiking on 7 miles of trails in the River Lakes Conservation Area. This area includes lakes Washington, Winder and Poinsett. Explore wetland communities, open vistas, wildflowers and grasses, as well as hardwood and palm hammocks. River Lakes includes both open and shaded areas to traverse. Wildlife is plentiful, so keep an eye out for native fauna such as wood storks, bald eagles, Florida sandhill cranes and river otters.
