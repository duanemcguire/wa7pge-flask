Enjoy hiking or biking 4.5 miles of varied trails or explore the park’s namesake falls. For a longer stay, head to the park’s designated swimming and picnic area, fish the cold waters of the Coginchaug River, and relax beneath great hemlocks and noble oak where nature provides her own air conditioning.
