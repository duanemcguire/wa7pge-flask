Today, more than 45,000 acres of rolling grasslands and woodlands in southeastern Arizona are protected under the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (NCA). The regionâ€™s oak-studded hills connect several "sky island" mountain ranges and lush riparian corridors. With its perennial flow, Cienega Creek forms the lifeblood of the NCA and supports a diverse plant and animal community. It is also rich in historic and cultural resources.
