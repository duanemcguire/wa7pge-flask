Tortolita Radio Club was formed in September, 2020.  The club welcomes members regardless of affiliation with other clubs.  We have no dues, no assessments, no assets, no regular meetings, and definitely no repeaters.  We are a bunch of friendly folks who get together to indulge our passion for HF ham radio.  We have done monthly on-air events such as Field Day, contests, Special Event Stations, National Parks, SOTA, POTA.  We have done outings for 8 years.
