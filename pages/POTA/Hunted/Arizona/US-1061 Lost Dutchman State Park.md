Named after the fabled lost gold mine, Lost Dutchman State Park is located in the Sonoran Desert, at the base of the Superstition Mountains, only 40 miles east of Phoenix. Several trails lead from the park into the Superstition Mountain Wilderness and surrounding Tonto National Forest. Take a stroll along the Native Plant Trail or hike the challenging Siphon Draw Trail to the top of the Flatiron.

Depending on the year’s rainfall, you might be treated to a carpet of desert wildflowers in the spring, but there's plenty of beautiful desert plants to see year-round! Enjoy a weekend of camping and experience native wildlife including mule deer, coyote, javelina and jackrabbit. A four mile mountain bike loop trail has opened at the park – this is a great way to enjoy the park's beauty while experiencing the famed Superstition Mountains!
