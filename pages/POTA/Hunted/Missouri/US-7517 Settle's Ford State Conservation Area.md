Settle's Ford Conservation Area is located on both sides of the South Grand River in southeast Cass and northeast Bates Counties and is easily accessed from Cass County Route B. This 7,364-acre area was purchased from willing sellers, primarily using federal funds provided as compensation for the Trimble Wildlife Area, which was inundated by the Smithville Reservoir.
