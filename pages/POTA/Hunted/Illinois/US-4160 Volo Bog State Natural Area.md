Fifty-six miles northwest of downtown Chicago lies Volo Bog State Natural Area, home to the only open-water quaking bog in Illinois. Formed in an ancient glacial kettle hole lake, Volo Bog features a floating mat of sphagnum moss, cattails and sedges surrounding the open pool of water in the center of the bog. Further from the open water, the mat thickens enough to even support floating trees!   Volo Bog - THE BOG - was dedicated as the 25th Illinois Nature Preserve in June, 1970.
