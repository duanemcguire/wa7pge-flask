title: US-10007 Oregon Coast State Trail
---

 The majesty of Oregon's 362-mile coastline unfolds around every bend along the Oregon Coast Trail, also known as the OCT. Hikers cross sandy beaches, meander through forest-shaded corridors, traverse majestic headlands and pass through 28 coastal towns.

Most of the route is on the beach, although some segments wind through state parks or public lands. Generous landowners provide trail easements for portions of trail on private property. About 10 percent of the trail is on the shoulders of U.S. 101, county roads and city streets.
Oregon Coast Trail Action Plan

A significant portion of the OCT follows the shoulders of roads and highways, such as U.S. 101. These gaps in the OCT can feel uncomfortable or unsafe and detract from the hiking experience. Some sections of the trail lack adequate supportive services and facilities, such as camping opportunities and potable water. The Oregon Coast Trail Action Plan describes how to remedy these gaps in the trail. This plan also addresses ways to improve trail amenities and services along the trail, including mapping and wayfinding, camping, restrooms, water crossing services, and a centralized trail information system.
