Trace State Park (formerly Old Natchez Trace Park) is a public recreation area located off Mississippi Highway 6, seven miles (11 km) east of Pontotoc and seven miles (11 km) west of Tupelo in the U.S. state of Mississippi. The state park surrounds 565-acre (229 ha) Trace Lake and is named for the nearby Natchez Trace trail. Famed frontiersman Davy Crockett once lived within the area bounded by the park.[2]
