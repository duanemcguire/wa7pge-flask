Indianaâ€™s newest state park, Prophetstown is located where the Tippecanoe River meets the Wabash near the town of Battle Ground northeast of Lafayette. The park's landscape has been shaped by ice from glaciers, moving water, fire, and human hands that helped maintain the vast tall prairie grass. Native American people hunted and lived along the two rivers for thousands of years.

Through our unique partnership with The Farm at Prophetstown, visitors can discover 1920s farm lifestyles, Native American culture and take a stroll through 900 acres of restored prairie. We are restoring native habitats such as wetlands, wet slopes called fens, prairies, and open woodlands.
