Eugene O'Neill had won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, and used the prize money to build what he named Tao House above Danville.[3] O'Neill and his wife lived in the home from 1937 to 1944.[4] By the time he moved here, O'Neill had already lived in over 35 places, but he called this secluded house his "final home and harbor".[5] At this home, O'Neill wrote his final plays: The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Hughie, and A Moon for the Misbegotten.[3] Due to a degenerative condition in his hand, he was unable to complete another play after 1943.[6]
