Castaic Lake State Recreation Area is one of the largest and most spectacular state water reservoirs in California! It not only provides fresh water to local communities, but this 12,658-acre facility is also a great local recreational escape for the entire family! This northern oasis features two lakes: the Upper Lake which offers two launch ramps for boating with various waterways and coves for exploring and the Lower Lake that includes picnic areas, launch areas for Kayaks, float tubes and other non-gasoline boating, and a swim beach.
