Often called a "hidden gem," Candlestick Point State Recreation Area (SRA) is a tapestry of grassy uplands, coastal salt marsh, intertidal mudflats, and pocket beaches where community members gather to fish, barbeque, exercise, ride bikes, kayak, windsurf, and find respite from the bustle of city life. It was established as Californiaâ€™s first urban park after many years of community organizing by Bayview Hunters Point residents who wanted to reclaim the land from junkyards that covered the shoreline.
