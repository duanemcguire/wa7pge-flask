The Steamboat Warehouse Historic Marker, located on the east bank of the Missouri River in Bismarck across the road from the water treatment plant on River Road (Highway 1804), commemorates the Northern Pacific Railroad warehouse built to store goods in transshipment between steamboats and freight trains. The 300-foot-long stone and frame warehouse was constructed in 1883 and was torn down in 1925. The interpretive marker also describes activity at the dock adjacent to the warehouse.
