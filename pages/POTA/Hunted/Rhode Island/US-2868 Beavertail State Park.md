Beavertail State Park in Jamestown, Rhode Island offers some of the most beautiful vistas along the New England coastline. You can enjoy this pristine landscape from one of four overlooks or walk the rocky coastline, which features excellent saltwater fishing. Beavertail attracts scientists of all ages for an exploration of its fascinating geology, ecology, and marine life. The Beavertail Lighthouse Museum offers historical information about the property, Narragansett Bay, and the shipping industry that helped shape Rhode Island. It also features a collection of artifacts from the third-oldest lighthouse in North America.
