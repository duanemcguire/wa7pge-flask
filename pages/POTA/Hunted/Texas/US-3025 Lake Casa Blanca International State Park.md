¡Bienvenidos!

Relax, fish, picnic and more at this lakeside park. Lake Casa Blanca is located in Laredo, just minutes from the Mexican border. Here you will find outdoor fun on water and land—and the perfect place for a family outing!
Things to Do

Water-ski, swim, boat and fish on the lake; or hike, bike, picnic, bird, geocache, study nature and camp along the shore.

Trails for mountain-biking and hiking will take you through beautiful and varied landscapes. The park also has a swim area, playgrounds, a baseball field, and tennis, volleyball and basketball courts. Webb County operates an 18-hole golf course nearby. Take a virtual tour with our Interactive Trails Map.

All campsites have water and electricity; some have sewer hookups, too. Reserve one of our picnic pavilions or group halls for your next gathering. We can host groups of 35 to 200.
Fishing

At Lake Casa Blanca, you might reel in a largemouth or hybrid striped bass, crappie or catfish. The park has a fishing pier and a boat ramp.
