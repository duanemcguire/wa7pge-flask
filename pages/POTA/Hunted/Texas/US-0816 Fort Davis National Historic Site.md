The historic site was established in 1961 to protect one of the best remaining examples of a United States Army fort in the southwestern United States. 

Today, 24 restored historic buildings and over 100 ruins and foundations[5] are part of Fort Davis National Historic Site. Five of the historic buildings have been refurbished to the 1880s, making it easy for visitors to envision themselves being at the fort at the height of its development. A self-guided tour of the fort begins at the site's visitor center. Living history demonstrations are common during the summer.
