title: US-3062 Antelope Island State Park
---

Antelope Island is a "desert oasis" just a few miles from the busy continuous metro area of Utah's Wasatch Front.   My home is in Clinton, Utah  just 7 miles from the causeway entrance to the park.

Ed Lueders and I agree that Antelope Island is a magical place.  I wrote about my meeting with Mr. Lueders in 2021, and excerpted his writing about Antelope Island on my [blog.](https://blog.duanemcguire.com/blog/antelope-island-jazz/)


Some pictures from my visits to the island:

## My Hunter Log
2024-06-29 [K0TTW](https://www.qrz.com/db/K0TTW) 20m CW
This was my third CW contact as a POTA hunter.  I heard a very strong signal, but was reluctant to call.   His 22 wpm was at my challenge level, but I went ahead, and he came right back.  After the contact I had a look at [https://pota.app.](https://pota.app.)   I laughed when I saw that he was at Antelope Island.  It's little wonder that he had a strong signal.  

## Activations
**10 QSOs 2024-08-09**
**Hooray!**  My first activation  
It was fun and challenging.  I got out to the island by 9 am before it got too hot, and set up at a picnic  shelter near Lady Finger Point.  I configured the [portable vertical antenna](../../../Antennas/Portable%20Vertical.md) that I built recently for 20 meters.  I'm still not a great [CW](../../../Operating_Modes/CW.md) operator, but  I wanted to do POTA CW.  After 7 contacts I was pretty wiped out from the stress of it all.  I went to SSB for one contact, and then came back to CW for two more.  With 10 contacts, I called it a day after working at it for an hour.
