Sibley State Park is a Minnesota state park near New London, on the shores of Andrew Lake. It is named for Henry Hastings Sibley, the first governor of the state. A city park in Mankato, Minnesota is also named for Sibley.[2]

The rustic style stone structures in the park were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1935 and 1938. These structures are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
