The Luce Line State Trail is a 63 mile long former railroad grade that is popular for biking, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and snowmobiling. The crushed limestone trail runs from Plymouth 30 miles west to the McLeod/Carver County line, with a parallel trail for horseback riding. From the McLeod/Carver County line to Hutchinson the trail is paved. From Hutchinson to Cedar Mills it is crushed rock, from Cedar Mills to Cosmos it is natural (mowed grass) and from Cosmos to Thompson Lake it is back to crushed rock. Snowmobiles are allowed on the trail west of Stubbs Bay Road.
