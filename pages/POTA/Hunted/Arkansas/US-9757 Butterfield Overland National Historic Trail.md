In 1857, Congress awarded businessman and transportation entrepreneur John Butterfield a contract to establish an overland mail route between the eastern United States and growing settler populations in the Far West. What became known as the Butterfield Overland Trail began from two eastern termini on the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee. The trail followed a southerly course through Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona before heading north through California to its western terminus in San Francisco. Its arcing sweep across the southern rim of the country gave it another name: the Oxbow Route. Its southerly aspect allowed for year-round service.
