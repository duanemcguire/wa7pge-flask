The 1,623-acre Canacadea State Forest has a limited amount of development. The unpaved public access road is not plowed in the winter. At the end of the left/north branch of the Department road is a maintained scenic vista, easily accessed in good weather. There are also unmarked, unmaintained deer paths, old skid roads and old farm lanes are available for exploring.

Today, Canacadea and all state forests in New York are managed for multiple benefits to serve the needs of the people of New York. Sustainable management practices will ensure a perpetual supply of timber, a diversity of wildlife habitats, compatible recreational opportunities and clean water.
