Federal Hill was the inspiration for Stephen Foster's famous ballad, 'My Old Kentucky Home.' Step into the days of the antebellum South as costumed guides escort you through the stately mansion and formal gardens. During summer months, the outdoor drama 'Stephen Foster - The Musical' is preformed under the starts in the park's amphitheater. Enjoy golfing, camping and picnicking.
