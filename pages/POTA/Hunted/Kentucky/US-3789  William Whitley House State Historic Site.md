The William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, stands today as a monument to pioneer ingenuity and resourcefulness.

It was the first brick home and circular racetrack built west of the Alleghany Mountains, completed in 1794 by William Whitley and his wife Esther. Dubbed the Guardian of Wilderness Road, the house was a gathering spot for early Kentuckians, including George Rogers Clark and Daniel Boone.
