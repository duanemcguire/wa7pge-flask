Come and explore nature along the Sheltowee Trace National Recreation Trail. This
trail traverses nearly 290 miles across narrow ridges and deep ravines. The trail is open
year round, so you can enjoy outdoor adventure in every season.

In the Daniel Boone National Forest, the Sheltowee Trace is considered the
“backbone” of an expansive interconnecting trail system. Many other trails link to the
Sheltowee Trace. Some trail connections provide loops for a short day hike, while
others offer opportunities for multiple days of recreational challenge.
