Fun contact!  My first Alaskan POTA contact.  Perhaps my first Alaskan contact.  I don't have logbooks from the 70s, but I suspect today's contact was the very first.

Approximately 44 miles southeast of Fairbanks along the Richardson Highway is the Salcha River State Recreation Site, a popular weekend getaway for residents of Fairbanks and Delta Junction.
THINGS TO DO

In the summer, the 61-acre recreation site provides anglers access to the Salcha River, which is fished for king, chum, and coho salmon as well as Arctic grayling, sheefish, and northern pike. Other popular activities include camping, boating, and picnicking. Snowmobiling and cross-country skiing on the frozen river are popular activities in the winter. Limited camping is available at the small campsite and the Salcha River public use cabin.
WILDLIFE AND LANDSCAPE

The Salcha River is a fast and clear 125-mile tributary of the Tanana River. Accessible by boat or on foot from the road, the river is a popular sportfishing destination due to its rich runs of salmon, northern pike, and Arctic grayling. The river’s surroundings are fairly dense forest, home to moose and caribou.
HISTORY

With the onset of the Fairbank’s gold rush of the late 1800s, prospectors utilized the Salcha River in the summer months. A roadhouse, store, and military telegraph office were established at the mouth of the river.
