Nestled within one of Nevada’s most scenic valleys, Washoe Lake State Park is a picture-perfect basecamp for exploring the Reno and Lake Tahoe areas. From the towering peaks of the Sierra Nevada to piney foothills and lush meadows, the park and surrounding landscape provide limitless outdoor fun. Its location 30 minutes from the state’s oldest settlements—Virginia City, Genoa, and Carson City—places it at the center of Silver State history.
