title: US-2687 Bottomless Lakes State Park
---

Located near Roswell, New Mexico, the area now known as Bottomless Lakes was originally part of a large Spanish land grant. The region's unique lakes are actually sinkholes ranging from 17 to 90 feet deep. They were formed by dissolving limestone and subsequent collapse.

Prior to its designation as a state park in 1933, local ranchers used the land for grazing livestock. It became New Mexicoâ€™s first state park thanks to Governor Arthur Seligman who saw potential for recreational development.

The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) played an integral role during the Great Depression era in developing infrastructure within these lands that would support visitor activities such as picnicking and swimming facilities; they constructed buildings still standing today. Historical features include remnants of past CCC projects like stone cottages and other structures which reflect early-20th-century craftsmanship.
