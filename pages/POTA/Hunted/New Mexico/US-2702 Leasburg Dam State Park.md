After a short 25-minute drive from bustling Las Cruces, youâ€™ll arrive at this quiet park along the Rio Grande.

Leasburg Dam State Park offers peace and relaxation, a beautiful cactus garden, several hiking trails, and opportunities for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and birding. Night sky programs are very popular at this park, which features an observatory.
