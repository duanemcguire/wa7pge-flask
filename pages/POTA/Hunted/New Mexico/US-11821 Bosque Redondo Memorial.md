In 2005, the New Mexico State Monuments Division (now Historic Sites) and the Museum of New Mexico Foundation, with strong support from the Diné and Ndé, created the Bosque Redondo Memorial. It stands today to acknowledge the events of the 1860s and to allow those affected by the history to have a voice to tell their history.
