Set against the dramatic Sacramento Mountains, this park features a historic ranch house, quiet camping in the Chihuahuan Desert, and pools of water under the cottonwood trees of Dog Canyon.  Springs flow year-round and ferns cling to the sides of mossy rocks.  The water in Dog Canyon has attracted people to the area for millennia.

The park’s namesake, Oliver Milton Lee (1865-1941) was a colorful figure in New Mexico history.  In 1893 he settled at the mouth of Dog Canyon and built an extensive house at his ranch headquarters.  At its peak, his holdings reached about one million acres.  Oliver Lee explored ways of bringing water to the dry Tularosa Basin and was instrumental in establishing the town of Alamogordo.  Lee is also credited for using his influence to attract the railroad to the area.

Oliver Lee’s home at Dog Canyon Ranch has been completely rebuilt from ruins.  It is authentically furnished providing visitors with a glimpse of Lee’s life at the ranch. The house is closed for renovations. Please monitor the park events page to find out when tours resume.
