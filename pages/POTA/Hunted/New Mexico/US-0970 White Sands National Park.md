title: US-0970 White Sands National Park

Like a mirage, dazzling white sand dunes shimmer in the tucked-way Tularosa Basin in southern New Mexico. They shift and settle over the Chihuahuan Desert, covering 275 square milesâ€”the largest gypsum dunefield in the world. White Sands National Park preserves more than half of this oasis, its shallow water supply, and the plants and animals living here.

All of this, and it is amazing to think that it is a national park that I have not visited!    Even though, I know that I drove right by it on Interstate 10 in 2017!
