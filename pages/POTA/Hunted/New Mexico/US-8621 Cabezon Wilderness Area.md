The Cabezon WSA is located in the northwestern part of the New Mexico and consists of a large volcanic plug - a steep-sided symmetrical neck of volcanic rock. At an elevation of 7,785 feet, this is the largest of a series of volcanic plugs in this area and is one of the most well-known landmarks in northwest New Mexico. This peak is a favorite among climbers. Basic mountain climbing experience and proper gear, including a helmet, are needed, but most will not choose to use a rope on the common route. A successful climb to the summit will reward you with an expansive view of the Rio Puerco Valley.
