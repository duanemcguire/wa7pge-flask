Located near the US border with Mexico, this historical park features an exhibit hall and structures that capture the rich history of the Pancho Villa Raid and Camp Furlong. The exhibit hall also showcases the Punitive Expedition led by John “Black Jack” Pershing in 1916-1917. This military expedition to chase down Pancho Villa threatened to bring the United States and Mexico into direct conflict during the height of the Mexican Revolution in Mexico itself.

The park also offers educational tours and artifacts that are on display from this historical event

The Pancho Villa Expedition—now known officially in the United States as the Mexican Expedition,[6] but originally referred to as the "Punitive Expedition, US Army"[1]—was a military operation conducted by the United States Army against the paramilitary forces of Mexican revolutionary Francisco "Pancho" Villa from March 14, 1916, to February 7, 1917, during the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920.
