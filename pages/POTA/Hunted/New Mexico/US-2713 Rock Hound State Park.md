Rockhound State Park is a state park of New Mexico, United States, located 7 miles southeast of Deming. It is named for the abundance of minerals in the area, and visitors can search for quartz crystals, geodes, jasper, perlite, and many other minerals. When the park opened in 1966, it was the first park in the United States to allow collection of rocks and minerals for personal use.

**Each visitor is allowed to collect as much as 15 lb of rocks and minerals from the 1,100-acre park; mineral dealers are not allowed to collect for sale.**
