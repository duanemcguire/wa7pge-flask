I know this is a nice little 20 watt radio, but I can't quite decide that I like it.  It is an amazing package for the price.   The receiver sounds really nice.   I've used it for a few POTA outings.  My hesitation with it relates to the size of the controls and screen.   For my old eyes, it's not the best.   The controls a rather fiddly, but there are a lot of options to work with.   I'll use it some more, and I should become better acquainted.
