Coming soon (or maybe later)!

### Harvey Wells TBS-50 Transmitter

This will be a project!   I purchased the  Harvey Wells TBS-50  recently, and I don't know how much work will be needed to get it on the air, but it's a hobby,  right? 

This model of transmitter is the first transmitter I used as a novice.   It was loaned to me and I used it until I acquired a more modern rigs.  It will be fun to operate again. 

The Harvey-Wells story is documented in the [October, 2025 edition of QST](/static/pdf/harvey-wells.pdf).

### Hammarlund Super-Pro

Another project.  I've been packing this receiver around for 55 years.   It was last powered up 40 years ago.   But when I was a novice in 1970 it was a gift to me, and it was paired with the Harvey-Wells to make up my first station.  It will be a huge project, if I choose to take it on myself.  

The Super-Pro was the gold standard of radio receivers in the late 1930s and early 1940s.
