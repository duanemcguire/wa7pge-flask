On a trip to Wyoming, I picked up the vintage Drake Receiver and Transmitter pair.   When I was a young ham, I "learned" that this was the finest equipment available for hams.   That may well be true for 1968 when the equipment was made.   Now 57 years later, I can afford it, and I'm the proud owner.  There have been advancements in technology in these six decades, and in side by side tests, it is easy to see that the receiver of my IC-7300 out performs the R4B.   But then again, the R4B may need some current attention. 

I've not yet fired up the transmitter.

The R-4B was produced from 1967 to 1973.  [Rigpix.com specifications](https://www.rigpix.com/drake/r4b.htm)
